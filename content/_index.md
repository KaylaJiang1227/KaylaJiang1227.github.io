        Hi, I'm **Kayla Jiang**, a Master's student in **Environmental Engineering at Stanford University**.  

        My research focuses on **microbial ecology, antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and environmental health**.  
        I am passionate about exploring how environmental factors shape microbial communities and developing strategies to mitigate AMR spread in water systems.
